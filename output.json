        "goal": "High-altitude mountaineering endurance preparation with rapid acclimatization support",

      },
      "solution_criteria": [
        "Provides minimum 4000 calories with high-altitude nutrient profile",
        "Includes electrolyte and protein balance for mountain performance",
        "Accommodates specified dietary restrictions",
        "Supports metabolic adaptation to extreme elevation conditions"

      "task_description": "Write a compact, concise 1 day meal plan for a single athlete",
      "scenario": "Test scenario targeting a high-altitude endurance athlete with extreme caloric and nutritional requirements, including unique dietary constraints like altitude acclimatization nutrition needs"
    },
    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The solution provides a structured meal plan with precise nutritional details and addresses most criteria. However, it fails to meet the 4000 calorie requirement and lacks comprehensive electrolyte/metabolic adaptation strategies. The mandatory requirements are mostly met, but key performance optimization elements are incomplete."
